Simple Watermarker Program

This project is based around TKinter and Pillow. It was my first time working with Pillow and it was fairly intuitive and the documentation was good.
The overall project didn't take very long to make, but I feel like I hadn't built anything like this before.

How it Works:
  In the text box enter the text you want marked onto your image.
  When you press the upload button, the program prompts you to select an image from your file directory and once you have and its a viable path, the 
  program then layers the text onto the image and shows the final image, from there a new save button should appear where you can give a name to the new file and save it

All in all this was a cool project and I'm glad to have made it!
